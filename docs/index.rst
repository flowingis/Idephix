Welcome to Idephix's documentation!
===================================

Idephix is a PHP automation tool useful to perform **remote** and **local** tasks.
It can be used to deploy applications, rotate logs, synchronize data repository
across server or create a build system. The choice is up to you. Idephix is
still in alpha, so things will change. You can report issues and submit PRs
(greatly appreciated :-)) on the `github repo <https://github.com/ideatosrl/Idephix>`_
